# pong
This is a little pong game created with processing (https://processing.org/) (Java).

I watched Daniel Shifmans Coding Challenge #67 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIrC5Qcb2G4) which I have modified in several aspects:

- different paddle check function
- game states: game over
- keylistener for multiple keys pressed (makes it better to play together)
- sounds added
